How it Works
============

viASP's backend generates the graph based on  

1. The input program
2. The marked stable models

The steps taken for generating the graph can be broken down in to two parts: first, the program is first sorted, then associated the atoms of the stable model with the rules they are derived by.

Sorting the program
===================

The input program is sorted by the viASP server. The program is received through the api calls ``load_program_file`` or ``load_program_string``. They reach the ``/control/add_call`` endpoint, which stores the program in the server database.

Once the ``show`` command is called, all program strings loaded in this session are retrieved from the database. The programs are then sorted by the server.

Every rule in the program becomes a node in the dependency graph. Dependents and conditions are analyzed to create edges between the nodes. 
Some processing on graph removes loops and cycles, and collects integrity constraints into a node. The rules in the loops or cycles are combined and marked to become a recursive component in the final graph.
When topologically sorted, the rules are ordered in a way so that rules that depend on other rules are placed after the rules they depend on.

The sorted program may be queried from the server using the ``/graph/sorted_progam`` endpoint.

Graph Generation
================

The justifier program is used to find out which rules are responsible for the atoms in the stable model. A justifier program is genertated by the ``ProgramReifier`` Transformer class using the sorted program.

From every rule in the sorted program, a justifier rule is generated 

.. code-block:: 

    # input rule
    d1 :- r1, ..., rl.

    # justifier rule
    h(I, d1, (r1, ..., rl)) :â€“ d1, r1, ..., rl.


The justifier rule connects the atom ``d1`` in the head of an input rule to the index ``I`` of the rule that derives it due to the reasons ``r1, ..., rl``. 

.. admonition:: Example

    For example, the rule

    .. code-block:: 

        reached(V) :- reached(U), hc(U,V).

    is transformed into

    .. code-block:: 

        h(1, reached(V), (reached(U), hc(U,V))) :- reached(V), reached(U), hc(U,V).

The justifier program is loaded in a clingo Control instance and combined with the stable model. Grounding yields the ``h`` symbolic atoms, which can be queried from the Control object. The grounding is repeated for every stable model.
