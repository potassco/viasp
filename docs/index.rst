viASP: An interactive ASP visualizer
=======================================

viASP generates interactive explanations of ASP programs and their stable models. A step-by-step break-down shows how the atoms of the stable models are derived.

viASP can be used via the command line or its Python API.

..
   comment viASP uses the clingo python API, a Flask server and a Dash frontend to generate the visualizations.
